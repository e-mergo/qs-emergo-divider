# E-mergo Divider

**E-mergo Divider** is a Qlik Sense visualization extension developed by [E-mergo](https://www.e-mergo.nl). This extension enables the dashboard designer to insert a visual indicator of separation between app visualizations.

This extension is part of the [E-mergo Tools bundle](hhttps://www.e-mergo.nl/e-mergo-tools-bundle/?utm_medium=download&utm_source=tools_bundle&utm_campaign=E-mergo_Extension&utm_term=toolsbundle&utm_content=sitelink).

This extension is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/e-mergo/qs-emergo-divider). You can report bugs and discuss features on the [issues page](https://github.com/e-mergo/qs-emergo-divider/issues).

## Why is this extension needed?
Within the grid system of Qlik Sense app visualizations are laid out without standardized means of indicating hierarchy or separation. There is only empty space in between the visualizations.

This extension provides a way to visually separate parts of the app by inserting a dividing line between visualizations. All the extension does is draw a line, either vertically or horizontally, distinguishing left from right and above from below.

## Disclaimer
This extension is created free of charge for Qlik Sense app developers, personal or professional. E-mergo developers aim to maintain the functionality of this extension with each new release of Qlik Sense. However, this product does not ship with any warranty of support. If you require any updates to the extension or would like to request additional features, please inquire for E-mergo's commercial plans for supporting your extension needs at support@e-mergo.nl.

On server installations that do not already have it registered, the Markdown file mime type will be registered when opening the documentation page. This is required for Qlik Sense to be able to successfully return `.md` files when those are requested from the Qlik Sense web server. Note that registering the file mime type is only required once and is usually only allowed for accounts with RootAdmin level permissions.
